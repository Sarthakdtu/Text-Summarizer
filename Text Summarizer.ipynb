He began by praising the scientific accomplishments that France had made in the past year and it was not until the end of his speech when he held up a gold statuette and called out Mark Harris s name that Kelly realized that Mark was the star of the evening. “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon “ You did ” “ You know what I said about your painting ” “ Yes. ” “ And go where They re going to be watching the airports train stations bus depots… ” “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon Diane was thoughtful for a moment.

The superintendent of the building Philippe Cendre was a tall attractive man with a “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon warm personality and his wife and daughter had always gone out of their way to be helpful. ” She raised her glass of “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon159 champagne and said to the empty chair next to her “ Thank you Richard darling. “ Is this the mysterious beau you wouldn t let us meet ” “ Do we know him ” “ What does he look like ” Kelly said proudly “ Like a young Cary Grant. Sometimes Rubenstein imagined he was a lion slowly closing in on his unsuspecting prey ready to pounce … or a cunning spider spinning a web that would eventually entrap them and leave them helpless…Sometimes he was a patient fisherman gently tossing a line into the water and slowly moving it back and forth until the gullible witness took the bait.

Kingsley I don t know what these questions— ” “ Did your husband tell you he had a big deal coming up and that he was going to make a lot of money ” Kelly was getting upset. The Nobel Committee has chosen you to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for this year for your innovative work in nanotechnology… ” The Nobel Prize When the conversation was over Andrew hurriedly dressed and went straight to his office. They shared an interest in art and “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon music and much more She felt attracted to him but she was not sure whether he felt the same way about her. “ I m not in the mood to talk about it ” Diane snapped “ but it could be very— ” Diane s voice suddenly echoed through the coffee shop.

After fifteen minutes Kelly asked “ How far do you want to go ” “ There s a spot up ahead that I like. “ Why What s the problem ” “ We have a report that a car with this license number has been smuggling drugs. ” “ What did he say ” “ He knows what s behind all this and he says from now on we re safe. “ Dinner and the theatre Or there are some stores open at night and then there s— ” “ I m sorry Mark. com “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon Prologue Berlin Germany Sona Verbrugge had no idea that this was going to be her last day on earth. ” “ Do you know if Herr Verbrugge was planning to take a trip somewhere ” “ No sir.

The wall between Kelly s bedroom and her mother and stepfather s bedroom was thin and night after night Kelly could hear the sounds of blows and screams. ” He had grown up in the shadow of his brother and it was galling to know that he was considered second best only because Andrew had gotten there first. “ I m going to get to work on this now ” he said “ but you ll be safe here. “ Panty hose … ” “ Bras… ” “ Slips… ” Soon their arms were laden with lingerie. ” Tanner said slowly “ But you re going to use this award to build up this business aren t you ” Andrew shook his head.

Only a few people knew that the juror s little daughter had disappeared and a note was left behind If you keep quiet about this your daughter s fate will be determined by the jury s verdict. ” *** The next morning when Kelly and Mark arrived at the salon Kelly pointed up to the sky. ” *** For the next three days Tanner slept on a cot in Andrew s room and stayed by his brother s side as much as the doctors would allow it. ” “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon Her fear was contagious but it made no sense. The men watched as the lighted area narrowed down to a street with a clothing store a restaurant a drugstore and a bus station. ” As Miller started to lead the two women toward the door he said “ I hope Gary s sister will be all right. ” I—I don t know what— But you did say he discussed everything with you Yes but— From what we have been able to learn your husband was apparently involved with this woman and— No This isn t my Mark we “ re talking about. Diane thought desperately I ve got to get out of here but how As she looked around the room her gaze fell on the attractive man sitting alone at the table across from hers. Tanner read the first e-mail aloud “ We would be delighted to come to dinner at KIG Headquarters on Friday to see the unveiling of Prima your weather control machine. Well what s next ” “ I m going to the FBI in Washington and tell them what I know. *** “ ‘ Vanished into thin air Are we talking about the Great Houdini or a damned elevator operator ” The speaker was Secretary General Claude Renaud in charge of Interpol Headquarters. “ What about him ” “ He was killed in a plane crash on his way here to see you. “ What—what happened ” “ Gary s plane hit the side of a mountain a few miles outside of Denver. ” “ But you don t want to marry me ” “ I do want to—but I—I can t.

On the advertising strip that ran above the windows was a photograph of a smiling Kelly holding up a beautiful ladies ” watch. ” “ Did you ever hear the phrase ‘ seeing someone through the eyes of love ” No one laughed. Here it comes she thought You have a great ass… I love your boobs… I d like to have your long legs wrapped around my neck… “ No ” Kelly said icily. ” “ And do you have a phone in your car ” “ Yes. Kelly asked “ What s your plan after we go to Washington Are you going to start painting again ” Diane was thoughtful for a moment. There—there will be a lot of words you ve probably never heard before and— ” “ I think I ve heard them all ” Kelly said piqued. ” “ Seven o clock ” “ I ll be there ” Kelly said. Diane tried to make conversation with Kelly but it was “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon hopeless.

For instance in Titian s Venus of Robin the diagonal sweep of her form is breathtaking and— ” From the kitchen they could hear the coffee percolating. ” “ What do you do For a living ” “ I work at KIG—Kingsley International Group. “ See how simple we made it ” Andrew said under his breath “ I remember… ” Tanner turned to Pauline. ” “ Do you have luggage ” Diane said glibly “ The airline lost our bags. She had bought a small charming bungalow with a view of the Rockies in the distance and from time to time her brother would visit her. ” “ Can you tell me how to reach her ” “ I m sorry. ” “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon She looked at him in shock. “ Can you tell me who— ” “ I ll tell you all about it when I see you. “ Mayday May— ” In the control tower they watched in shock as the blip on the radar screen disappeared. “ And yesterday you two found the body of Richard Stevens on the bank of the East River. “ Would you please get me a reservation on the next plane to Paris ” “ Certainly Mrs. ” “ When did you begin painting ” “ When I was a child. “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon Tanner turned to the waiter. “ Miss Murphy if you mean by that that the majority of people seem to believe that money is more important than morals I regret to say you re probably right.

I m developing a method of … ” Tanner s mind drifted to something more important the hot little redhead he had met the night before. He would spend the night at his sister s home and in the morning he would be on his way east to meet the others. ” “ You don t know who she was ” “ I have no idea. If you d like me to call the manager can— “ No ” She suddenly realized what had happened and felt a small shiver. She began to sketch the face of the man who had tried to kill her but her hands were trembling so hard that she had to stop. ” “ Then we have a go-ahead ” “ You have a go-ahead. “ I wonder which are yours and which are mine ” “ It doesn t matter ” Diane assured her. ” “ You re going to have them followed ” “ That was yesterday John. They— ” “ Do you remember what they rented ” “ It was a Peugeot. There was no “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon way she could afford that on a salary. ” “ What are you going to do now ” “ Get out of Manhattan. ” The rest of the story went on to call it a “ freakish event. ” She watched as Flint strode to the end of the cabin and pulled open the rest-room doors. ” She gave the secretary the number and heard the secretary slam the phone down. ” *** When Kelly arrived at the fashion salon and walked in the stage door Pierre the nervous fashion coordinator was waiting. I— ” “ You re an artist aren t you ” She was taken aback by the question. As they walked away Kelly said “ Why don t we just put up a neon sign telling Kingsley where we are ” Diane said “ You worry too much. ” “ It looks like a lot of people tried to meet with the senator but none of them made it Diane. ” “ And were they still aboard when the plane took off ” “ Yes sir. “ Let s see “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon102 where Kelly Harris is. “ Yes ” “ I saw your—I read this article about you and it says that you were born in Philadelphia. ” “ Can you lose them ” “ I don t have to. ” “ What now ” “ I have to make a quick phone call. “ I thought you were on your way to Paris ” “ I took a detour. ” *** The saleswoman watched in amazement as Kelly and Diane went through the rest of the racks. ” Kelly said curtly “ I have the same feeling—but it s not going to happen to me. There was a small barred window at the far end of the room and a heavy door leading into the room. It was too late to do anything now but in the morning she was going to make the phone call that would avenge her brother s murder. ” “ What Who—who— ” “ We can t discuss this on the phone Diane. I don t know anyone here except the people at the model agency and I have a feeling they wouldn t be a lot of help. “ What is not understandable is that when the police responded to your call they went into the cabin and not only was no one there Mrs. “ When I found out that Akira Iso in Tokyo and later Madeleine Smith in Zurich were close to solving the problem I offered them jobs here so I could control them. ” Chapter Flint asked “ What do you want me to do with the bodies ” Tanner did not hesitate. ” “ While you re doing that I m going to fly to Berlin and talk to people who worked with Franz Verbrugge. It was Kelly who began most of the conversations and no matter what the subject was she found that Mark was knowledgeable and amusing. They both hurried back toward the entrance of the hotel but the doorway was so crowded that there was no way for them to get back inside. “ What the hell are you— ” “ If you won t pay it then forget it you cheap bastard. And who s going to give us those names ” “ I ll show you ” Diane said. What are you doing in town ” “ I came to see my mother but I wanted to see you too. Diane said “ Where are you going ” “ I m going to get a new hairdo. She heard the rear window smash as a bullet went through it and then a crack as another bullet hit the back of the car. “ I m the bearer of good news that I thought was too important to discuss on the telephone. ” Tanner pressed a button and on a huge screen appeared a picture of a massive pink palace with ceremonial guards standing watch while its lush beautiful gardens glimmered in the bright sunlight. By the way what are you going to do with your half of the money ” Diane looked at her. ” “ What s your favourite thing to do Kelly ” “ I enjoy soccer games. ” The women got out and walked up to the front door of the house. “ My God ” Kelly had said “ that s the man who tried to kidnap me. ” Diane started to put it back then looked at Kelly and handed the dress to the saleslady. When I saw you here I—I thought maybe you didn t like having lunch alone and that you and I could— ” Kelly gave him a scathing look. He regarded her a moment and said “ What happened ” “ Some—some men tried to get in here. ” “ What ” “ I ve been here all the time waiting. When Kelly reached the dressing room the wardrobe mistress said “ I have the evening gown ready for you. Once inside he transferred all her balances to the line of credit then returned to Experian s credit data base and cancelled her line of credit under “ In Collection. ” Tanner was— “ Andrew Get in here ” Andrew heard the command got up and slowly walked into Tanner s office. He offered his condolences then said “ Kelly I realize this is not the appropriate time but I think that getting back to work might be good for you right now. A pedestrian had suddenly darted in front of the Mercedes and the driver jammed on the brakes to avoid hitting him. *** Andrew was lying on the couch in his office and his mind drifted to the huge stage of the Stockholm concert hall. “ The Chrysler Corporation is looking for— ” And Andrew smiled and said “ Let s do our real job. Most of the day Andrew sat in his chair looking out the window half asleep but he seemed happy to be back at Kingsley Group even though he had little idea of what was going on. “ Your place ” “ Yes I have a little pied-a-terre on Park Avenue ” she said. Do you have any idea how trite it is …Are you feeling horny darling …Get out your little black book and we ll try to find someone who s available for you tonight… It was as though he needed to exorcise her.

In the Wall Street Journal reported that a Russian company Elat Intelligence Technologies was selling weather control equipment tailored to specific needs using the slogan “ Weather Made to Order. “ What— ” “ Why don t we take the car ” he said softly. “ Andrew we could get contracts from some of the big companies and— ” “ That s not what we do Tanner. ” There were murmurs of “ Thank you ” and Tanner watched the men depart. I ll pick out a casket and— ” “ No ” The word came out harsher than Diane had intended. The apartment had a double-door entry that opened into an elegant hall with high ceilings and soft yellow wall panels and the living room was furnished with an eclectic mixture of French and Regency furniture. The press was invited to a dinner party to visit Prima a new weather control computer that KIG developed but yesterday there was an explosion at KIG and Prima was completely destroyed. “ That s a real coincidence isn t it ” Diane said “ And I just remembered something. Kelly said contemptuously “ Would you like me to send for the ghost catchers ” Diane started to retort but stopped. “ Kelly Kelly You re late The show has already started and— ” “ I m sorry Pierre. And I will prove to you and the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that Mr. There s no use “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon trying to— ” —at my place. No matter what happens I want you to know that I— There was a sudden loud commotion at the back of the park. ” “ But the money I m offering you— ” “ No. ” In the surveillance room Retra Tyler was watching Kelly on the television set and recording the scene. ” The receptionist spoke into a phone and moments later the manager a gray-haired pleasant-faced man came out to greet Diane. ” “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon120 Kelly looked into his eyes. A flight attendant asked “ May I help you ” “ FAA inspection ” Flint said. ” “ And it worked didn t it You had to see me again to teach me a lesson.

In a little while Diane Stevens and Kelly Harris would be disposed of and with them out of the way the project could continue. They— Kelly s voice called out “ Are we going to have breakfast or dinner ” *** They were walking to the restaurant. ” The officer walked to the side of the car and approached them. To tell me that you had the evidence we needed to— ” She saw the stricken look on Kelly s face. “ Do you think if I talked to Altieri he might leave us both alone ” Greenburg said “ That s an interesting question.

The last time she had seen him was a week ago and she saw the scene in her mind unspooling like a blurred film through her tears.

What is it I can do for you ” “ We d like to talk to you Mr. “ Are You Afraid of the Dark ” By Sidney Sheldon As Mark Harris recognized them he felt a sense of relief. “ Don t I know you ” He looked at her for almost a minute as he concentrated and then his face lit up. ” “ Were you on duty last October fourteenth ” “ Yes I was. ” *** When Kelly returned to the lobby of her hotel she walked over to the desk. “ Oh my God ” They rose and hurried to the door waiting for the next stop. “ Don t you know they ll be watching all the airports ” “ I hope so.

The receptionist said “ May I help you ” “ My name is Diane Stevens. Kelly and the security guard walked outside and as they reached the taxi stand Kelly said “ Thank you verymuch. Kingsley don t you think your brother might be better off in a home ” “ Of course he would ” Tanner answered. ” “ What is ” “ Going back to a life without Richard. ” Kelly said “ I wish we had— ” “ I know.\n",

Andrew walked into the room to put on his suit and Tanner was there to wish him luck. “ Are you crazy I told you I m in a hurry. ” She picked up the telephone and dialled the hotel operator. ” In the middle of the night Diane wondered.

Diane said “ That s why Richard and Mark were going to Washington to see Senator Van Luven. Diane was signing an autograph when a man came up behind her and said “ I like your curves. ” Diane glanced at the clerk to see if there was any recognition on his face. ” “ All you have to do is press it three times at six o clock.

You said the Delmont Hotel ” “ Yes on Eighty-sixth Street. ” A few minutes later they emerged into a glade with an enormous oak tree in the centre. “ You ve got to take care of whatever is wrong ” he yelled. What s our next false move ” “ We have to get out of here. I have the New York Times the Washington Post and Larry King all holding for you. ” “ Yes… ” His chief security guard stood next to him.

Kelly s captor led her to the back door of the SUV. “ She was a decoy to throw people off the track. ” *** When they got back to the boarding house Kelly made a telephone call. In the distance the sounds of approaching sirens were filling the air. “ Aren t you tired darling ” “ Get on your knees. I would never send an innocent man to— ” “ The key word is innocent Mrs. ” Diane s heart was beating so fast it felt as though it was going to leap from her chest. ” “ Those monthly rendezvous were frustrating because I knew you had to leave.

When the woman was out of sight Diane rushed outside and got into the car. “ Kelly— ” Berry looked at the ring again and nodded. ” Diane opened her purse took out some bills and gave them to the clerk. His name was scribbled on a note found in the jacket pocket of a dead man in New York. “ Did anyone ever tell you you snore ” Diane felt a small shock. ” *** Ten minutes later Kelly was on her way to the hotel. “ We re going after KIG ” “ That s right. “ I m Sam Meadows ” he said to Kelly. Where s the door ” “ We ll find it. I have no— ” Richard said “ I heard they have stores in Paris. — Flint s thoughts were interrupted as he heard someone approaching the door and he tightened his grip on the gun. “ The next flight out of Denver to New York is a red-eye. ” *** Next to the For Madame shop was a pharmacy. “ No I was just… ” Tanner studied his brother a moment. In boom times and in depressions the city always seemed to wear the same impassive face.

Sincerely The wilton hotel for Women was thirty-five minutes and a world away from the Mandarin.

He turned his head to scan the board that listed the arrivals and departures. ” While they were eating Tanner said “ You work for a very fine company Tokyo First Industrial. ” “ Get her for me ” Tanner said. ” “ How did your meeting with Sam Meadows go ” Kelly could still hear his screams. Tanner pressed a button and the scene on television moved into the president s office. She waited until the elevator door closed then headed for the stairs and started to walk up. ” It took him a moment and then his smile lit up the room. ” The driver glanced at her in the rear-view mirror. Did your brother say anything to you that might help us ” Lois Reynolds opened her eyes again and looked at Diane puzzled. Will that be cash or charge ” “ COD ” Kelly said. ” He moved the luggage cart out of the way. When the dinner plates had been cleared the president of the French Academie des Sciences appeared onstage. ” “ I d like to speak to Betty Barker please. ” She slammed down the receiver and walked back to Kelly. ” As Kelly opened her eyes she looked in the side-view mirror and froze. But your company Kingsley International Group has contracts for many projects with our government and yet you re challenging the government on the environment issue. ” Kelly watched him walk out the door carrying the magazine with him. “ Yes ” “ You wear it. ” *** The three of them had lunch the following day. When the taxi had gone a block Kelly said “ Oh I forgot something. ” He reached in his pocket and handed the guard a hundred-dollar bill. Tanner Kingsley and former senator Pauline Van Luven were on the plane along with a pilot co-pilot and a steward. Business began to flourish at an extraordinary pace and Tanner changed the company name to Kingsley International Group just as he had planned. “ What s this ” “ This is your half. The two men had already donned the heavy protective suits that were required for the experiment. ” “ I d like to talk to Yvonne Renais.

In the meantime if there is anything that I can do for you—anything you need I am at your service. She had to speak to the people where Frau Verbrugge had worked and find out what they knew. ” “ I d like to speak to Betty Barker. But Kelly watched the enthusiasm on Mark s face and she was glad she was there. “ What happened ” “ Someone—someone s broken in here. ” He paused and said pointedly “ I hope he doesn t get hurt. ” “ Get back to the office. ” Chapter As they drove into White Plains twenty-five miles north of Manhattan Diane said “ This looks like a nice town. Diane s heart began to pound and she felt the blood rushing to her face. “ What ” Kelly said “ Our husbands worked for KIG. They re going to give you something to make you well… All you need is a little rest. All the employees were touched by how well Tanner treated his brother and how solicitous and caring he was of him. ” She smiled and said “ Lets make it a month. “ Are you all right Madame ” “ Yes. Did you have a satisfactory flight ” “ Yes thank you. Angry neighbours whose pets were being tortured and killed complained to the authorities and a trap was set. At the end of three weeks Henry said “ I love you Lois. He decided he would see her once more to give her the comeuppance she deserved and then forget about her. ” How can I tell her that I feel like a freak I don t feel beautiful. ” Kelly said “ Then maybe I ll stick around New York for a while. There s a saying that if you give a man a fish he can have a meal. ” “ Anything you want ” Andrew said. ” “ I hope so ” Diane replied. “ On that table ” he said “ very gently. ” She saw the expression on the driver s face. In fifteen minutes there will be a police cruiser outside your apartment building for the next twenty-four hours and we ll see what we can find out by then. And by the way I think we made the Guinness Book of World Records. “ He ll swim with the fishes ” Somebody s seen TheSopranos too many times. ” *** On his way back to New York Tanner thought Now all I have to do is convince Andrew. ” The Kommandant turned to the detective. “ Does this involve a man ” “ Yes. “ Where is Angel ” “ Oh your little dog Philippe took her with him. ” He walked over to the door and opened it. The first thing Diane did when she arrived home was to hurry into the atelier. “ Don t you see This is—this is the last thing I can ever do for Richard. ” Diane looked at him tearfully and said “ Oh thank you. ” “ I don t think we have anything to be frightened about anymore. ” “ You re here about the Gary Reynolds crash. I didn t think they would pursue the matter any further but just to be safe I set a trap. How can we have a future together if you don t have a future ” Tanner took her hand. Kelly said “ Sorry I m late Diane but the traffic was terrible. “ Don t you get tired of reading these in your dentist s office ” Praegitzer grinned. ” She turned and walked into the lobby and an exasperated Diane followed. We know why they killed our husbands and why they re going to kill us but there s no way we can ever tell the world. ” “ That would be nice ” Diane said absently. “ I m sorry ” “ Angel is mine. “ From what I read of your husband s death in the newspapers Mrs. I went to about a dozen different foreign schools and learned to speak a few languages in self-defence. Chapter When diane awakened in the morning Kelly was sitting in a chair facing a wall. Princess and I have to leave now but at six o clock I want you to turn this computer off.
